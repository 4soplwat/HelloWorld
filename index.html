<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>
  Html is a type of coding that stands for hypertext markup language. It is used to insert words and images along with changing the font and color of your own webpages. Html has been used for many years and has gone through many revisions and changes.

  I chose to take this Webpage Design class for a few reasons. First, because I can see myself using these skills in the future to build a website for wherever I end up working. Also, because coding just seems really interestig as it is sort of like another language.
